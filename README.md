# E-Waste Image Classification Using EfficientNetV2B0 (Transfer Learning)

Welcome! This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to automate the classification of electronic waste (e-waste) images, making recycling smarter and more efficient. If you want to see machine learning in action and contribute to a greener planet, you’re in the right place!

## 🌍 Problem Statement

E-waste is a growing environmental and health concern across the globe. Sorting and categorizing e-waste is crucial for recycling, but doing this by hand is slow and prone to mistakes. Our project solves this by teaching a computer to recognize different types of e-waste from images—instantly and accurately.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

**Can a computer look at a picture of e-waste and tell you what it is?**  
With EfficientNetV2B0 and transfer learning, our deep learning model can classify e-waste images into 10 categories—helping recyclers and enthusiasts alike!

---

## 📦 Dataset Overview

- **Dataset:** [E-Waste Image Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshat103/e-waste-image-dataset)
- **Categories:**  
  - PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
  - Player
  - Battery
  - Microwave
  - Mobile
  - Mouse
  - Printer
  - Television
  - Washing Machine
  - Keyboard

Feel free to explore the images and see if you can guess the correct category—can you beat the AI?

## 🚀 Try It Yourself!

You can **interactively test the model** using our Gradio demo!  
Just upload an image of e-waste, and get an instant prediction.

```python
# In your Python environment:
import gradio as gr
# ... (load model code) ...
# gr.Interface(fn=your_predict_function, inputs="image", outputs="label").launch()
```
Or run the provided notebook in **Google Colab** for a guided, hands-on experience.
